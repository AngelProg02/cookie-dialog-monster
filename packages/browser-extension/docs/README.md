# Cookie Monster Dialog Browser Extension

This browser extension was designed to remove cookie consent dialogs that appear on websites without setting your preferences. Only in a few cases, it operates based on predefined rules specified in the file `data/fixes.txt` from where the extension will automatically decline or accept the cookie consent dialogs.

Please note that the `data/fixes.txt` file should be regularly updated to reflect changes in websites' cookie consent practices and to ensure accurate handling of the dialogs by the extension.
